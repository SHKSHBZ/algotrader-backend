# Portfolio Backup Configuration Update

## Summary
Modified the paper trading system to automatically save all `paper_trading_portfolio_*.json.bak` backup files to the "Reports Day Trading" folder instead of cluttering the main project directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `paper_trading.py`
- **File**: `c:\Users\shaik\OneDrive\Algo_Trader 25_10_2025\algotrader-backend\paper_trading.py`
- **Method**: `_save_portfolio_state()` (lines 564-573)
- **Change**: Updated backup file path to save in "Reports Day Trading" folder

**Before:**
```python
backup = self.portfolio_file.with_name(f"paper_trading_portfolio_{ts}.json.bak")
```

**After:**
```python
# Save backup files to Reports Day Trading folder
reports_dir = Path('Reports Day Trading')
reports_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # Ensure directory exists
backup = reports_dir / f"paper_trading_portfolio_{ts}.json.bak"
```

### 2. Moved Existing Files
- Moved 108 existing `paper_trading_portfolio_*.json.bak` files from the main directory to the "Reports Day Trading" folder
- Used PowerShell command: `Move-Item -Path "paper_trading_portfolio_*.json.bak" -Destination "Reports Day Trading\"`

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Directory Structure**: Main project directory is no longer cluttered with backup files
2. **Organized Reports**: All trading portfolio backups are now in a dedicated folder
3. **Automatic Folder Creation**: The system automatically creates the "Reports Day Trading" folder if it doesn't exist
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Main portfolio file (`paper_trading_portfolio.json`) remains in the root directory for easy access by other components

## Testing

Created and ran `test_portfolio_backup.py` which confirms:
- ✅ Reports Day Trading folder is created automatically
- ✅ Backup files are saved to the correct location
- ✅ File naming convention remains the same
- ✅ No impact on main portfolio file location

## Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Main portfolio file location unchanged
- **Dashboard/API Compatibility**: No changes needed for web dashboard or API endpoints
- **Future Backups**: All new backup files will automatically go to the Reports Day Trading folder

## Date
